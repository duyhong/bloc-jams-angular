# Bloc Jams

Bloc Jams is a digital music player like Spotify. This is a  single-page application built on AngularJS framework.

## Pull Down the Code

Start by cloning the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/duyhong/bloc-jams-angular.git <your-project-name>
```

## Reset Git

This will be your personal application. So all of the past commit history that I used to build this  app aren't needed. Also you will want to be able to push/pull code from your personal remote (Github) repository and NOT my remote (Github) repository.

Remove the existing local Git repository:

```
$ rm -r -f .git
```

## Configuration

The project uses Node to run a JS server in development. This will be important when we want to use urls /album or /collection instead of the basic album.html or collection.html. 

### Install Node and NPM

NodeJS and NPM are installed together by [downloading an installer from the Node website](https://nodejs.org/). The install button should automatically detect your operating system, but if it doesn't, you can choose the proper version from the [downloads page](https://nodejs.org/download/).

Install the project dependencies by running:

```
$ npm install
```

## Run the Application

Run the application server:

```
$ npm start
```

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run npm start to start the application. You will then be able to access it at localhost:3000

The server will start up. To stop the server, press `cntrl + c`.
